# Zero noise extrapolation challenge

## Notebook
Readers are welcome to read the notebook first. It contains the experimentis with the implementation in `util.py`.
Its first cell has all the config and comments. One may want to change this before running the notebook, but the config leaving there already works.

The implementation of the global folding and the extrapolation as requested by the task are in `utils.py`.


## Running on a real quantum machine
I tried to run the IBM but the queueing is quite long. I am based in the EU but somehow my available region is only in Australia and Japan
