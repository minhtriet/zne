# Zero noise extrapolation challenge

## How to run
Install packages from `requirements.txt` and `jupyterlab`.

## Notebook
Readers are welcome to read the notebook `zne.ipynb` first. It contains the experiments with my implementation in `util.py`.
The first cell has all the config and comments. One can change this before running the notebook, but the config leaving there already works.

The implementation of the global folding and the extrapolation as requested by the task are in `utils.py`.


## Running on a real quantum machine
I tried to run the IBM but the queueing is quite long. I am based in the EU but somehow my available region is only in Australia and Japan
